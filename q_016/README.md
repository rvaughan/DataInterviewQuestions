# Points within an interval

You are given j integer intervals in the format [a,b] (e.g. if j = 2, would get
list of 2 intervals [a,b], [c,d] where a, b, c, and d are integer #s). The
absolute value of the coordinates is bound by a value M. 

Build a Python function that determines whether or not a given point belongs to
the maximum number of intervals provided.
