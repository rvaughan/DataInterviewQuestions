# Relationship between fitness and smoking

Given the data table below, determine if there is a relationship between fitness
level and smoking habits:

| Category | Low fitness level | Medium-low fitness level | Medium-high fitness level | High fitness level |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Never smoked | 113 | 113 | 110 | 159 |
| Former smokers | 119 | 135 | 172 | 190 |
| 1 to 9 cigarettes daily | 77 | 91 | 86 | 65 |
| >=10 cigarettes daily | 181 | 152 | 124 | 73 |

You don't have to fully solve for the number here (that would be pretty
time-intensive for an interview setting), but lay out the steps you would take
to solve such a problem.
