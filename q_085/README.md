# Testing user conversion

Given the following [data set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WnKwSW--x835Uokeq6xInuHg3xxdOyoKcuVfFVcV870/edit?usp=sharing), can you see if there's a significant difference between the conversion rate of users between the test and control group? The relevant columns in the table are conversion and test. The conversion column has values of 0 and 1 which represent if the user converted (1) or not (0). The test table has values of 0 and 1 as well, 0 for the control group and 1 for the test group.
