# Largest elements in an array

Given an array with k distinct elements, write a function to return all elements that have at least two elements greater than themselves in the same array:

For example, given the following array:

```python
array = [2,3,9,7,6]
```

Your function should return: 

```bash
[2,3,6]
```
