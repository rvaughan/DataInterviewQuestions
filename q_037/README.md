# Employees who are managers

Suppose you're trying to understand how many managers you have per employee at
Company XYZ. On your search to understand, you are given two tables: (1) managers
and (2) employees. Each table has 1 column named id. 

Given this dataset, can you use SQL to find the employees that are also managers?
Hint: given the table names as well as the single column name you should be able
to write a full SQL query.
