# SQL Patterns

Suppose you're given the following table, called 'employees':

| name | job_role |
|------|----------|
| John | Analyst |
| Harry | Administrative Business Partner |
| Sam | Software Engineer |
| Tina | Analyst |

To test your SQL skills, create a query that returns the name and job_role of
each individual who has either a name that contains the letter 'a' or a job role
that ends in the letters 'er'.
