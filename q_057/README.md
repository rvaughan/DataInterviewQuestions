# Probability of selecting a wardrobe
Suppose Charlie has 3 pairs of shoes, 4 different coats, and 2 different pants
to wear in his wardrobe. Of those items, Charlie has exactly one pair of white
shoes, exactly one black coat, and exactly one pair of khaki pants.

If Charlie selects each item of his wardrobe at random, what is the probability
that he will wear the white shoes, black coat, and khaki pants? Hint: think of
the rule of product here.
