# Longest palindrome substring
A palindrome is "a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as
forward." Below are some example palindromes:

  * madam
  * racecar
  * tat

Can you write a python function that takes in a string and outputs the longest
palindrome? If the string itself is a palindrome, the function would output the
original string.
