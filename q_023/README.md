# Drawing cards from a standard deck, once more

Suppose we have a standard (52 card) deck of cards, with an equal share of the
cards associated with each of the four "suits" (e.g. clubs, spades, diamonds,
and hearts). You can read more about a standard card deck here.

Question: If you were to draw 3 cards from the deck, one a time, what is the
probability that you draw a club, a heart and a diamond in any order? Be sure
you can explain your reasoning here using probablity theory.
