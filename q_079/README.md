# Channel attribution

Suppose you’re working at a company similar to Airbnb, and the marketing team has come to you to help them figure out which channels (excluding direct) are best for them to focus on. You are given a data set, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uNa9tpo8AEeJ9va_PU5AoIj430Iu4VFkML6twCyYy2A/edit#gid=166651861).

Below are the column descriptions for the data set.

|--------|-------------|
| id | unique user identifier |
| date_account_created | the date of account creation |
| gender | user's gender |
