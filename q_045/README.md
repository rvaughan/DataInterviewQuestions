# Defective gaskets

Suppose you're working in a parts manufacturing plant, and you're running quality
analysis on the gasket production line. Gaskets produced by your company will be
defective 1% of the time, and are distributed in packs of 20. 

Your company has a policy where if 1 or more of the 20 gaskets in a given pack
is defective, they will replace the entire package. What proportion of packages
does the company need to replace?

If you're struggling with where to start here, consider that this is a [binomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution)
probability problem.
