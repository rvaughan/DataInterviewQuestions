# New strain of flu

You go to see the doctor about a cough you've had for a while. The doctor
selects you at random to have a blood test for a new strain of flu, which for
the purposes of this exercise we will say is currently suspected to affect 1 in
10,000 people in the US. The test is 99% accurate, in the sense that the
probability of a false positive is 1%. 

The probability of a false negative is zero. You test positive. What is the new
probability that you have this strain of flu?
