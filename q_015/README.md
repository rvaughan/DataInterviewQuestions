# Drawing cards from a standard deck

Suppose we have a standard (52 card) deck of cards. Each card has an equal
chance of being one of the four "suits" (e.g. clubs, spades, diamonds, and
hearts).

## Question

If you draw 3 cards from the deck, one a time, what is the probability that you
draw a club, a heart, and a diamond in that order?
